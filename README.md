## It's project time!

### Project Prep

Before you write any code it's important to map out the functionality of your web application and what it is going to look like. Remember MVP (minimum viable product) and start out with the simplest possible functional app that you can create. Once you get that up and running you can add features later. 

Check out the wireframing module on Ironboard and try using [Gliffy](http://www.gliffy.com/) to create a blueprint of what your application should look like.

### Project Timeline

You'll only have about 2.5 class sessions to complete your app so it is important to get organized and create a timeline. If you are working in a group, assign specific tasks to each team member and make sure everyone knows what each person is working on. Communication is key! 

Here is a sample project timeline to help you get organized. 

###Day 1
+ Complete a project outline and wireframe
+ Set up your Sinatra template
+ Get your routes set up
+ Create basic versions of your views (with buttons, links, etc. even if you don't have that functionality read yet) 

###Day 2
+ Set up your model
+ Get your models connected up to your route
+ Test out your app

###Day 3
+ Debug
+ Make your views look pretty
+ Prepare your demo/presentation
